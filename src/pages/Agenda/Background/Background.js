      <p className="background-paragraph">Jharkhand, often referred to as the "Land of Forests," was established as a separate state in
November 2000, following its separation from Bihar. The state encompasses a total
geographical area of 79.71 lakh hectares, out of which an estimated 38 lakh hectares are
classified as cultivable land. However, the actual net sown area amounts to only 18 lakh
hectares. Despite being abundant in natural resources, agriculture serves as the primary
occupation for 80% of the rural population in Jharkhand.
</p>
  <p className="background-paragraph">
The agriculture sector in Jharkhand is characterized by its dependence on nature, low
investment, low productivity, mono-cropping system, and small-scale farming. The dominant
crop is paddy, covering approximately 16.2 lakh hectares out of the total net sown area of 18
lakh hectares. The 92% of the cultivated area lacks irrigation facilities in Jharkhand. However,
the state's cultivable land resources possess immense potential for increasing productivity and
crop intensity.
</p>
  <p className="background-paragraph">
As the agricultural sector in Jharkhand undergoes a transformation, it presents lucrative
business opportunities for private sector companies involved in seeds, agrochemicals, farm
machinery, and technology-driven agricultural advisory services.
Now is the opportune time to become a part of Jharkhand's agricultural growth story. By
participating in 'JOHAR DHAN - 2023,' you can explore the available opportunities, build your
network, and contribute to the agricultural development of the state.</p>
